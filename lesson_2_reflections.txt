What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	I don't know. Whatever man.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	Answer: It is something in the middle. nothing done until commit??

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Answer: Run git diff, see differences between staging area and working directory and then commit. Maybe need to git reset some files to limit changes
